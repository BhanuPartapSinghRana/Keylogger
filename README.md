## 📌 About the Project

This project demonstrates how a **basic Python-based keylogger** works. It records every keystroke made on the system and saves them in a `.txt` file.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 🎯 Records all keystrokes
- 💾 Saves output in a hidden text file (`keylog.txt`)
- 🐍 Built with Python
- 🧪 Run silently in the background
